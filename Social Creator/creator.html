    <h3>Another Digital Experience</h3>

    <h4>While I was working on my project I became a social creator for a coffee shop. </h4>

        <ul>
            <li>In June I traveled to Florida, Carolina and Mexico for 2 months. Therefore, I could not keep up with creating new posts for the coffee shop every day, as working as a social creator requires presence. Nevertheless, it was a great experience and I am very grateful for it.</li>
