    <h2>About My First Digital Experience</h2>
<hr />
    <p>I have never had a big passion for drawing on paper. Whenever I was bored, I took a pencil and I started transforming my ideas onto paper. I have to say, I was excited for painting on canvas more. I remember the first moment when I opened the app ProCreate on my IPad in November 2022 and I fell in love with digital art. I found my potential in drawing illustrations.</p>
    <p>When you love something, it is easy to get better. What is important to you is learning new skills and pushing them higher. Sure, I am blessed to be able to draw, but drawing illustrations is something what you need to learn and practise too.</p>
<br />
    <p>I am lucky that I didnÂ´t have to practise a lot, because of my drawing skills. I was maybe bit of a dreamer and I drew to get more projects. So I started to learn about technology in my IPad, I learned about the ProCreate app and I was pushing my skills higher.</p>
    <p>After 6 months of drawing, finally I got a project. But let me show you some of my digital art first before I show you the actual project.</p>
