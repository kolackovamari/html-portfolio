    <h2>Enjoy My First Digital Drawing!</h2>
    <p>I drew these illustrations in 3 months after I bought my IPad. As you can see from my pics, I am more of a childrenÂ´s illustrator. Those where my first steps when I decided to start with digital art. Children are close to me, deep down I still feel like a child too. And then, nature, buildings and structures can makes my eyes dancing.</p>

        <h3><li>Piece of Nature</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Where do you look for inspiration? I grew up in a small village and I saw a lot of beautiful nature all around me. Try to find your inspiration around you. Go back deep into your mind and try to become a child again. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><li>Buildings and Scructures</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This work is not finished yet, but I like how it looks now. Watching the construction process is my favourite thing. How can someone build something so amazing? </li>
