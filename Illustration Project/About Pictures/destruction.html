    <h2>Destruction of the Forest</h2>
<hr />
    <h4>And what about our behavior? We have already destroyed 60 % and we are still continuing. Instead of natural landscape, we have, at the best case, fields, and at worst, concrete stock boxex and shopping centers. We are destroying forests to reduce the price of inferior food by a few percent for using palm oil.</h4>
