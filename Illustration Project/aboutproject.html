    <h2>Illustration Project about World Changing</h2>
    <h4>Project of my 14 Illustrations for agricultural and horticulture company 
    <a href="https://www.dakr.com/">Dakr s.r.o</a></h4>
    <p>I do not have to describe how many emotions I felt for creating this amazing project. I was lucky, happy, in love but for sure I was scared if everything would be perfect. Let me share with you a little piece of advice.</p>
    <h5>Just be yourself, take your time, listen to your ideas and do not be scared if someone will not like it. What is important is following your instructions, learning about the topic and do not forget to talk about your project with others, especially with your boss about common needs.</h5>
    <p>And if you have just a little bit of passion for your work, it will be easy and perfect. You will become better with every step if you practise your present knowledge.</p>

    <p>Our vision was to create a text document, which I received as a backround for my drawing. The document is about the change which our world uderwent in the 21st century. As we can see, our world is not in the best condition as it was before. Our planet is evolving and parts of nature are beying destroyed.</p>
    <p>We would like to share with people that we can still help our nature breathe as nature lets us breathe. I chose 10 illustrations of our project and if you click on each of them, you can read more.</p>

    <h4>Do you know what is amazing? The project is not only about pictures. We are now working on creating an animated movie with my illustrations and a text document that I recieved, which will be completed in January 2024.</h4>
